# ClubLens


## Overview

Create interactive bubble chart visualization of student groups using Python, particularly Matplotlib and Plotly Express libraries. The visualization is designed to help students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) find the most suitable student organization based on various criteria.

## Features

- **Bubble Chart Visualization:** The main feature of this project is a bubble chart that visually represents more than 100 student organizations at UIUC.
  
- **Data Representation:** The size of each bubble is proportional to the number of members in the corresponding student organization, providing a quick glance at the scale of each group.

- **Color Representation:** The color of the bubbles reflects the activity level of each student organization, determined by the number of meetings + events held per month.

- **Dynamic Positions:** The positions of the bubbles on the chart are dynamic and are based on five preference inputs. This dynamic arrangement ensures that the most suitable group for the user is visually prominent. User can hover over each bubble to see detailed description of the group.
  

## Requirements

Matplotlib
Plotly Express


## Running the Visualization:
